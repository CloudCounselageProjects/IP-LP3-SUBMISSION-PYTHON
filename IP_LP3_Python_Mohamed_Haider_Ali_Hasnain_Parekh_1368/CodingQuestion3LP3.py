#CODING QUESTIONS:â€‹4 (This code was executed in Visual Studio Code)
#Little Robert likes mathematics. Today his teacher has given him two integers and asked to find out how many integers can divide both the numbers. 
# Would you like to help him in completing his school assignment?
#Input Format : There are two integers, a and b as input to the program. 
#Output Format: Print the number of common factors of a and b. Both the input value should be in a range of 1 to 10^12.
# Input:  10  15
# Output: 2

        while temp<a:
            if a%temp==0 and b%temp==0:
